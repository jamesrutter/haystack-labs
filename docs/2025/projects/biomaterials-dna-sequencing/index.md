## Project Overview
Portable bio-lab setup in the ceramics studio for land and sea bioprospecting, including nanopore DNA sequencing in a heated "hot-box" and bacterial pigment printing on various substrates.

## Goals & Objectives
- Establish portable bio-lab capabilities in non-traditional space
- Conduct environmental DNA sequencing of local samples
- Develop bacterial pigment printing techniques
- Create living "paintings" using cultured microbes

## Background & Motivation
This project brings cutting-edge biotechnology tools to the craft context, enabling biological exploration and artistic creation using living systems and environmental samples.
