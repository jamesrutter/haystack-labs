## Project Overview
The "Inner Bodett" camera-calibrated plotter frame auto-rectifies camera views so hand sketches become CNC tool-paths, built directly on the ShopBot. Includes vector cleanup scripts that auto-close tiny gaps after Live-Trace for cleaner machining.

## Goals & Objectives
- Create seamless sketch-to-CNC workflow
- Develop camera calibration system for accurate conversion
- Build vector cleanup tools for better machining results
- Enable rapid prototyping from hand drawings

## Background & Motivation
This project addresses the "Bodett Problem" - the need for intuitive ways to convert hand sketches into precise machine instructions without complex CAD software.

## Contributors 
- Quentin Bols√©e (vector tools)
- Tom Bodett (concept)
- Neil Gershenfeld
- James Rutter

## Technical Requirements
- ShopBot CNC machine
- Camera system for sketch capture
- Calibration software
- Vector tracing and cleanup software
- Simple wooden frame construction
- Computer vision processing capabilities

## Applications & Integrations
This project bridges traditional sketching with digital fabrication, making CNC accessible to artists and designers who prefer drawing to CAD. It connects with other plotter and drawing projects in Labs.
