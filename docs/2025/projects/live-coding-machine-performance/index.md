## Project Overview
Live-coding performance system featuring laser-engraved postcard scores, inertial-sensor pom-pom wand control, and networked MIDI/OSC communication for real-time machine performance.

## Goals & Objectives
- Create real-time machine control through live coding
- Develop gestural interfaces using motion sensors
- Generate laser-cut musical scores
- Build networked performance systems using MIDI/OSC

## Background & Motivation
This project explores the intersection of live coding, digital fabrication, and performance art, creating new possibilities for human-machine collaboration in real-time creative contexts.
