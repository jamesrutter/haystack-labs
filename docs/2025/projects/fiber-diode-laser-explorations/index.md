## Project Overview
Multi-material engraving tests using fiber and diode lasers on copper, stone, cardboard, and embossed wood, combined with upgrading a $400 desktop mill with $19 diamond-impregnated bits for precision machining.

## Goals & Objectives
- Test laser engraving capabilities across different materials
- Upgrade affordable desktop milling equipment for better performance
- Document process parameters for various material combinations
- Establish workflows for combined laser/mill fabrication

## Background & Motivation
Exploring the intersection of laser engraving and precision milling to create hybrid fabrication workflows using accessible equipment upgrades.
