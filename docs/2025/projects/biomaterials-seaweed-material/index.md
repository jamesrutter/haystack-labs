## Project Overview
Comprehensive exploration of seaweed and algae for artistic applications, including pigment extraction, cyanotype printing on algae film, laser-etched wood tiles, and zine compilation documenting the process.

## Goals & Objectives
- Extract natural pigments from seaweed and algae
- Develop cyanotype printing techniques on algae-based films
- Create laser-etched wood tiles with organic patterns
- Document the entire process in a comprehensive zine

## Background & Motivation
This project explores the intersection of traditional printmaking techniques with sustainable materials harvested from the marine environment, creating new possibilities for eco-conscious artistic practice.
