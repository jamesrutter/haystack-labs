## Project Overview
Wearable bio-lab development including a DNA ring project using extracted DNA samples, exploring the intersection of personal genomics, jewelry, and portable biotechnology.

## Goals & Objectives
- Create wearable biotechnology devices
- Develop DNA extraction and preservation techniques
- Design jewelry incorporating biological materials
- Explore personal genomics in artistic contexts

## Background & Motivation
This project investigates the integration of biotechnology with personal adornment, creating intimate connections between individuals and their genetic material through wearable art.
