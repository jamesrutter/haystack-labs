## Project Overview
A servo-driven animatronic eye sculpture featuring moving eyelids and a BB-8-style magnetically controlled iris, creating an interactive robotic sculpture with lifelike movement.

## Goals & Objectives
- Create realistic eye movements using servo mechanisms
- Implement magnetic iris control system inspired by BB-8
- Develop interactive behaviors and responses
- Explore uncanny valley effects in robotic art

## Background & Motivation
This project explores the intersection of robotics and sculpture, creating an unsettling yet fascinating interactive artwork that challenges viewers' relationships with artificial life.

## Contributors 
- Core robotics team (multiple contributors)

## Technical Requirements
- Servo motors for eyelid movement
- Magnetic actuation system for iris
- Microcontroller for control
- 3D printed mechanical components
- Sensors for interaction
- Power supply and control electronics

## Applications & Integrations
This project connects with other kinetic and interactive projects, potentially sharing control systems and techniques with the tentacle drawing robot and other Labs robotic projects.
