## Project Overview
Knitted glass beads filled with water for potential acoustic sensing applications and experimental "paint-ball" tests, exploring the intersection of textiles and audio technology.

## Goals & Objectives
- Create knitted structures incorporating glass beads
- Experiment with water-filled beads for acoustic properties
- Test acoustic sensing capabilities
- Develop hybrid textile-audio interfaces

## Background & Motivation
This project investigates textiles as acoustic sensing platforms, combining traditional knitting techniques with experimental audio technology.

## Contributors 
- Victoria Manganiello

## Technical Requirements
- Knitting equipment
- Glass beads of appropriate size
- Water filling capabilities
- Audio recording/sensing equipment
- Testing apparatus for acoustic experiments

## Applications & Integrations
This project connects textile fabrication with experimental audio work, potentially linking to other acoustic projects and knitting machine work happening during Labs.
