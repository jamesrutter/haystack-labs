## Project Overview
A 2-axis stepper motor rig that drags a large tentacle across paper to create drawings, with a planned live-coding interface for real-time control and performance applications.

## Goals & Objectives
- Build a large-scale drawing machine using unconventional drawing implements
- Develop live-coding interface for real-time artistic control
- Create performative drawing experiences
- Explore the intersection of robotics and artistic expression

## Background & Motivation
This project explores machine-mediated mark-making using organic forms as drawing tools, bridging digital control systems with tactile, expressive output.

## Contributors 
- Mickey McManus (concept/drawings)
