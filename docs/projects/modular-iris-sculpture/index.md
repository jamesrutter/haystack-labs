## Project Overview
Modular iris mechanism prototyped in multiple materials including glass and wood, exploring the mechanical and optical properties of aperture-like structures as sculptural elements.

## Goals & Objectives
- Create functional iris mechanisms in various materials
- Explore optical and mechanical properties
- Develop modular construction techniques
- Integrate precision bearings with handcrafted materials

## Background & Motivation
This project investigates the iris as both functional mechanism and sculptural form, bridging precision engineering with traditional craft materials.
