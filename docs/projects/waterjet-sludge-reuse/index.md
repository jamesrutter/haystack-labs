## Project Overview
Comprehensive sludge recycling project mixing garnet waterjet sludge with clay for ceramic tiles, grinding stones, and modular blocks, plus laser surface vitrification and experimental "worst soap ever" and woodpecker tree slip casting.

## Goals & Objectives
- Recycle waterjet garnet sludge into useful ceramic materials
- Create ceramic tiles, grinding stones, and modular blocks
- Experiment with laser vitrification of ceramic surfaces
- Develop soap-making from sludge materials
- Create slip-cast forms using natural tree cavities

## Background & Motivation
This project addresses industrial waste streams by transforming waterjet cutting byproducts into functional ceramic materials, demonstrating circular economy principles in the digital fabrication context.
