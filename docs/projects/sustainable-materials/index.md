## Project Overview
Algae material processing combined with stereogram/magic eye pattern creation, including conversion of patterns for knitting machine production and integration with cyanotype printing techniques.

## Goals & Objectives
- Develop algae processing techniques for material applications
- Create stereogram and magic eye pattern generation systems
- Convert patterns for knitting machine compatibility
- Integrate with sustainable printing processes

## Background & Motivation
This project explores the intersection of sustainable material processing with computational pattern generation, creating new possibilities for bio-based artistic materials and automated pattern production.

## Contributors 
- Arthur Harsuvanakit (algae processing)
