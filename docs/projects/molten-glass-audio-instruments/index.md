## Project Overview
Copper-solder coils and sensors designed to sonify hot glass during glass-working processes, creating live audio instruments from the heat and movement of molten glass for performance applications.

## Goals & Objectives
- Create audio instruments from glass-working processes
- Develop temperature-sensitive audio interfaces
- Enable live performance with molten glass
- Explore the intersection of craft and experimental music

## Background & Motivation
This project transforms the traditional craft of glass-working into a musical performance medium, using the thermal and physical properties of hot glass to generate sound.

## Contributors 
- Glass working team
- Audio collaborators
- Live performance artists

## Technical Requirements
- Glass-working furnace and tools
- Copper wire and soldering equipment
- Temperature sensors
