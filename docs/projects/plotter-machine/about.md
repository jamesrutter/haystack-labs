# Plotter Machine Project

The Plotter Machine project represents our exploration into precision drawing tools and the intersection of digital design with physical creation. This custom-built plotter combines traditional pen-and-paper techniques with computer-controlled precision.

## Project Overview

Our plotter machine is designed to create high-quality line drawings, technical diagrams, and artistic pieces using various drawing implements. The project focuses on accessibility, precision, and artistic expression.

### Key Features

- **High Precision**: Sub-millimeter accuracy for detailed work
- **Multi-Tool Support**: Compatible with pens, markers, and specialty drawing tools  
- **Custom Software**: Purpose-built control software for artistic workflows
- **Open Source**: All designs and code freely available

## Technical Specifications

- Drawing area: 24" x 18" (610mm x 457mm)
- Resolution: 0.1mm step precision
- Speed: Variable, optimized for quality over speed
- Control: Custom G-code interpreter
- Interface: Web-based control panel

## Build Process

The machine was constructed using a combination of aluminum extrusion, 3D printed components, and standard hardware. The design prioritizes modularity and serviceability.

## Applications

We've used the plotter for:
- Technical documentation illustrations
- Artistic explorations in generative design
- Workshop demonstrations
- Prototyping drawing-based interfaces

## Future Development

Planned improvements include:
- Automatic tool changing system
- Enhanced software features
- Community workshop integration
- Documentation and tutorial expansion
