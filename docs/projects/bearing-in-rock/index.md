## Project Overview
Precision pocket-milling a ball-bearing seat directly into a found stone using mods CAM software, demonstrating ultra-precise machining of natural materials.

## Goals & Objectives
- Achieve precision machining tolerances in natural stone
- Integrate found objects with manufactured components
- Explore the intersection of natural and artificial forms
- Document CAM workflows for irregular surfaces

## Background & Motivation
This project explores the boundaries between natural and manufactured objects by precisely machining functional mechanical components into found stones, creating hybrid objects that challenge traditional material hierarchies.
