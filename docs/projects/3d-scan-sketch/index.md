## Project Overview
High-resolution 3D scanning of seaweed, drawings, circuits, and rock textures for rapid CAD/CAM workflows, combined with digital microscopy documentation capabilities.

## Goals & Objectives
- Create high-resolution 3D scans of natural and manufactured objects
- Document micro-scale features using digital microscopy
- Develop rapid workflows from scanning to CAD/CAM fabrication
- Build a comprehensive digital archive of textures and forms

## Background & Motivation
This project addresses the need for high-quality digital documentation of both macro and micro-scale features for design and fabrication workflows. By combining 3D scanning with microscopy, we can capture details across multiple scales for comprehensive digital records.
