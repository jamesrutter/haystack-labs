## Project Overview
"Woodstock 25" laminated silk-wood panels combining silk, veneer, and copper wire in plywood composites, machined and milled for sound and art objects.

## Goals & Objectives
- Develop novel silk-wood composite materials
- Integrate conductive elements (copper wire) into composites
- Create machinable panels for artistic applications
- Explore acoustic properties of hybrid materials

## Background & Motivation
This project explores the integration of traditional textile materials with wood composites, creating hybrid materials that can be digitally fabricated while maintaining organic properties.
