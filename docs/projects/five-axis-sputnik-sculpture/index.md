## Project Overview
Programmed rotary ShopBot tool-paths for creating a rotating spiky "Sputnik" form with integrated LED feedback, exploring advanced CNC capabilities and kinetic sculpture.

## Goals & Objectives
- Develop 5-axis CNC machining techniques
- Create complex rotating sculptural forms
- Integrate LED feedback systems
- Explore programmatic tool-path generation

## Background & Motivation
This project pushes the boundaries of CNC fabrication by creating complex, kinetic sculptures that incorporate both mechanical movement and electronic feedback systems.

## Contributors 
- CNC crew
- Advanced machining team

## Technical Requirements
- ShopBot with rotary capabilities
- 5-axis CNC programming software
