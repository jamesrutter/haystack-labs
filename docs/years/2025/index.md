The 2025 Haystack Labs brought together 30+ makers, researchers, and artists from June 1-6 for an intensive week exploring the intersection of digital fabrication, sustainable materials, and traditional craft practices. The program emphasized sustainable practices through bio-based materials research, waste stream reuse projects, and the development of open-source tools designed for accessibility and community sharing. Cross-disciplinary collaboration was fostered as participants combined traditional studio techniques with cutting-edge digital fabrication, synthetic biology, and environmental science, establishing ongoing partnerships that continue to advance both technical innovation and social impact beyond the residency week.
