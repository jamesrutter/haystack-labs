# 3D Printing Safety & Best Practices

This guide covers essential safety information and best practices for using the 3D printers in Haystack Labs.

## Safety First

### Ventilation
- Always ensure proper ventilation when printing
- Use the fume extraction system for ABS and specialty filaments
- PLA is generally safe but still requires adequate airflow

### Temperature Safety
- Never touch the hot end or heated bed during operation
- Allow printers to cool completely before maintenance
- Use tools, not hands, to remove stuck prints

## Lab Policies

### Scheduling
- Reserve printer time through the lab booking system
- Maximum 8-hour continuous prints without supervision
- Clean the bed after each use

### Material Guidelines
- Lab-provided PLA is free for experimental use
- Personal filaments must be approved (material safety data sheet required)
- No experimental or unknown materials without prior approval

## Best Practices

### File Preparation
- Always slice files using lab-approved settings
- Include support material for overhangs > 45Â°
- Test small sections before committing to large prints

### Troubleshooting
- Check the troubleshooting flowchart before asking for help
- Document recurring issues in the lab notebook
- Never attempt hardware repairs without supervision

## Getting Help

Lab assistants are available during posted hours for training and troubleshooting support.
