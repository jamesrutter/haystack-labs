# Arduino Basics for Artists

This tutorial introduces artists and makers to Arduino microcontrollers, focusing on creative applications rather than technical depth.

## What You'll Learn

- Basic electronics concepts
- Setting up the Arduino IDE
- Reading sensors (light, temperature, motion)
- Controlling outputs (LEDs, motors, speakers)
- Simple project examples

## Prerequisites

- No prior electronics experience required
- Computer with USB port
- Arduino Uno kit (available in the lab)

## Project Examples

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to create:

- Light-responsive sculptures
- Sound-reactive installations
- Motion-triggered displays
- Simple robotic movements

## Getting Started

The lab has Arduino kits available for checkout, and this tutorial can be completed in about 2 hours.
