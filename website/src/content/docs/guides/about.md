description: A brief overview of Haystack Labs
---

Haystack Labs is a one-week experimental program that invites a diverse collection of creative professionals from around the world (mostly US-based, though) to explore the relationship between craft and technology. Over the span of the week, participants will work on producing new processes, tools, machines, and other resources that may inform the craft community. This is not a formal conference or summit, rather a charrette in that people will be intensely working during their time at Haystack with the intentions of producing projects that fall within the craft and technology domain.
