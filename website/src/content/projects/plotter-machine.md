# Collaborative Plotting Machine

The Collaborative Plotting Machine is an open-source project that combines digital fabrication with algorithmic art to create unique portrait interpretations.

## Project Overview

This project explores how machines can interpret and recreate human portraits through algorithmic processes, creating a bridge between digital photography and physical drawing.

## Technical Details

- Custom pen plotter built with Arduino and stepper motors
- Computer vision algorithms for edge detection and line generation
- Web interface for uploading photos and customizing output
- Modular design for easy replication and modification

## Current Status

The machine is fully functional and we're currently refining the algorithms for better portrait interpretation. The next phase involves creating a series of collaborative portraits with lab participants.

## Open Source

All hardware designs, software, and documentation are available under open-source licenses to encourage community contribution and replication.
