# Biomaterial 3D Printing

This project aims to create a closed-loop system for producing 3D printing filaments from local organic waste materials.

## Goals

- Develop recipes for biodegradable filaments using food waste
- Create easy-to-replicate processing equipment
- Document the entire process for community replication
- Test applications in art and design projects

## Research Areas

- Polymer chemistry for optimal print characteristics
- Local waste stream analysis
- Equipment design for small-scale production
- Testing protocols for strength and durability

## Timeline

Currently in the research and planning phase, with initial prototyping scheduled for March 2025.
