        <h3>Semi-Structured Schedule</h3>
        <p>
          The program features morning planning meetings with all participants
          and evening short presentations. The rest of the day depends on what
          participants are working on and may include pop-up demos, tutorials,
          meetings, collaborative projects, and independent studio/lab time.

        <h3>Daily Expectations</h3>
        <p>
          Participants attend morning planning meetings to share progress and
          seek support from the group. A daily schedule of activities is loosely
          assembled during these meetings. All participants help document their
          projects and contribute to the larger knowledge base of technology and
          craft.

        <h3>Studio Access</h3>
        <p>
          Studio experts in particular craft fields are invited as participants
          to facilitate crossover experimentation within studios and guide
          others through new processes. All studios (except Glass) are
          accessible for participants to interact and experiment with.

        <h3>Evening Presentations</h3>
        <p>
          Each evening features rapid-fire artist talks where participants have
          5 minutes to present their work. These presentations are grouped into
          themes like Art & Impact, Machines and Architectures, Materials and
          Processes, and Design and Interfaces.
