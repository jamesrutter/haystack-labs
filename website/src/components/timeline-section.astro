          <p class="text-light-seafoam">
            Haystack Mountain School of Crafts and the MIT Center for Bits
            and Atoms developed and piloted the first experimental
            residential program (July 12-16). The week brought together
            artists and scientists to explore the integration of emerging
            technologies and processes for craft. 12 projects emerged from
            the week, including ClayStack ceramic 3D printing, Urumbot
            drawing machine, and pop-up bio labs.

          <p class="text-light-seafoam">
            The program expanded to include a broader collection of people
            from both craft and digital fabrication communities (May 23-27).
            Over 40 people participated and contributed to various
            innovative projects. New equipment was donated, including a
            Form3L SLA printer, ShopBot Rotary Indexer, and Bantam CNC
            machine.

            The program featured 40 speakers across 5 nights of
            presentations, covering topics from computer science and coding
            to design innovation and computational design. Participants
            included professors, artists, researchers, and industry leaders
            from institutions like MIT, Stanford, Tufts University, and
            companies like New Balance and Topologic.

            Held September 6-9, the program focused on projects including
            lattice structures, bioplastics, metal clay experiments,
            biomaterials, large format 3D printing, and electronic sensors.
            The program continued to emphasize open-source documentation and
            collaborative innovation.
