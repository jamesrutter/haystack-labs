          <h2>What is Haystack Labs?</h2>
          <p>
            Haystack Labs is a one-week experimental residential program that
            invites a diverse collection of creative professionals from around
            the world to explore the relationship between craft and technology.
            Over the span of the week, participants work on producing new
            processes, tools, machines, and other resources that may inform the
            craft community.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is not a formal conference or summit, rather a charrette in
            that people will be intensely working during their time at Haystack
            with the intentions of producing projects that fall within the craft
            and technology domain.
          </p>

          <div class="highlight-quote">
            "Artist residencies are valuable because they take you out of your
            usual context and shake up your thinking. Haystack + Fab Lab is
            amazing because it takes these machines and puts them in an entirely
            new creative context, which changes how you see them. Haystack Labs
            is like a residency for machines / machine residency because
            machines (like the artists) are going to a new context and exploring
            creative possibilities."

          <h3>What Labs is NOT:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>A Conference</strong> — it is not a ticketed event or a collection
              of talks, presentations, and workshops
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A Residency</strong> — it is not a time for an individual to
              come work solo on an independent project
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exclusively for digital fabrication projects</strong> — while
              technology is usually a strong component, the definition of "technology"
              can be stretched to include experimental materials and other forms
              of research
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>What Labs IS:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>An invitational program</strong> bringing together interdisciplinary
              professionals
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>A collaborative environment</strong> similar to a Hackathon
              (tech), Charrette (architecture), or Jam Session (music)
            </li>
            <li><strong>Interdisciplinary</strong> by design</li>
            <li>
              <strong>Free</strong> for participants (room & board provided)

          <h2>A Brief History</h2>
          <p>
            Haystack Labs began as a collaboration between Haystack Mountain
            School of Crafts and the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms, creating an
            experimental program that has evolved and grown over five successful
            years.

              <div class="year">2021 - The Pilot</div>
              <p>
                <strong>July 12-16, 2021:</strong> Haystack Mountain School of Crafts
                and the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms developed and piloted the first
                experimental residential program. 12 projects emerged from the week,
                combining artists and scientists to explore the integration of emerging
                technologies and processes for craft. The pilot was so successful
                it was expected to become a recurring event.

              <div class="year">2022 - Expansion</div>
              <p>
                <strong>May 23-27, 2022:</strong> The program expanded to include
                a broader collection of people from both craft and digital fabrication
                communities. Over 40 people participated and contributed to various
                innovative projects. New equipment was donated including a Form3L
                SLA 3D printer, ShopBot Rotary Indexer, Bantam CNC, and Shaper Workstation.
              </p>

              <p>
                The program continued with 40 speakers across 5 nights of
                presentations, featuring topics ranging from computer science
                and coding to craft, design innovation, and community programs.
                Participants came from prestigious institutions including MIT,
                Harvard, Tufts, Yale, University of Michigan, and leading
                companies like New Balance and Topologic.

                <strong>September 6-9, 2024:</strong> The program focused on projects
                including lattice structures, bio-printing and mycelium, digital
                knitting, large format printing with wood composite, experimental
                textiles, electronic sensors, and inflatables. Participants worked
                on sustainability initiatives and accessible design pathways.

                Building on five years of success, Haystack Labs continues to

                technology communities to push the boundaries of making and
                innovation.

        <section id="format">
          <h2>Program Format</h2>
          <p>
            The format of the program is semi-structured with plenty of
            open-ended time to explore and experiment. The program combines
            collaborative work time with structured sharing and learning
            opportunities.
          </p>

          <h3>Daily Schedule</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Morning "Stand Up" Meetings:</strong> Project teams share progress
              and ask questions to the group for things they might need help with.
              These usually run 30 minutes to set participants free to work on their
              projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Open Work Time:</strong> The rest of the day is entirely dependent
              on what participants happen to be working on but could include pop-up
              demos, tutorials, meetings, collaborative projects, experimentations,
              investigations, deep-dives, and independent studio/lab time.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Evening Presentations:</strong> Short presentations in a rapid-fire
              artist talk format, with participants having 5 minutes to present their
              work.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Project Teams</h3>
          <p>
            Approximately 5-8 groups are organized around a focus area, topic,
            design challenge, or project. The groups are fluid so people can
            interact with multiple groups as the program progresses. Each group
            has an assigned representative or leader with a clear goal or
            motivation to accomplish activities related to the group.
          </p>

          <h3>Studio Access</h3>
          <p>
            All studios (with the exception of Glass) are accessible for
            participants to interact and experiment with. Studio experts in
            particular fields of craft are invited as participants to help
            facilitate crossover experimentation within studios and guide other
            participants through new processes.
          </p>

          <h3>Documentation & Deliverables</h3>
          <p>
            Participants are expected to document their projects and help
            contribute to the larger knowledge base of technology and craft.
            Past iterations have produced short project videos, website
            documentation, and open-source sharing of code and designs via
            GitHub.
