# Overview

What Labs is **not**: 

* *A Conference* — it is not a ticketed event or a collection of talks, presentations, and workshops.   
* *A Residency* — it is not a time for an individual to come work solo on an independent project (that's what [OSR](https://www.haystack-mtn.org/open-studio-residency) is for)  
* A program exclusively for digital fabrication projects – while technology is usually a strong component, the definition of “technology” can be stretched to include experimental materials and other forms of research.   

What Labs is: 

* *An invitational program* — invitations are best done through past Haystack participants (OSR, Labs, Faculty, SAs, FLSAs, Residents, VAs, ... ) or through our Labs alumni network, meaning current and past participants can nominate people to attend. If you would like to nominate someone to come, please contact James – [james@haystack-mtn.org](mailto:james@haystack-mtn.org).   
* A [Hackathon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) (tech) and/or [Charrette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charrette) (architecture) and/or [Jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jam_session) (music) — Some cocktail of these three formats; I don't know if any of these are a perfect fit, but they come close enough to describing the format.   
* *Interdisciplinary*   
* *Free*; BYO-self. Haystack is not able to cover the cost of travel for participants but will support participants in the form of room & board. If you have never been to Haystack, we have a collection of residential cabins and a kitchen that provides three awesome daily meals. Project materials are available as needed, but please check with James first to see what is available and what Haystack may be able to support. 

The goals of Labs are to: 

1. Make technology and/or experimental processes more accessible for artists.    
2. Bring new ideas, knowledge and resources to the school.   
3. Provide professional development opportunities for participants.   
4. Document new technologies and craft processes as they are being developed.  
5. Cultivate an interdisciplinary community of professionals and creatives, interested in collaborating on experimental projects. 

A good participant for Labs is: 

* Collaborative   
* Generous   
* Has a skill that compliments one of the working groups   
* An educator or passionate about learning/educating audiences.    
* Is working on an interesting project/research area conducive for collaboration (optional) 

# How do I participate?

This is the most frequently asked question as this program is a new format to Haystack and is not the easiest to explain. That said, the best way to participate is by either 1\) proposing a project or 2\) collaborating on an existing project and lending your expertise to groups is appropriate (see project section below). 

## Do you have a project in mind that you would like to work on? 

Great\! Share this at the planning meeting, email James ([james@haystack-mtn.org](mailto:james@haystack-mtn.org)), or discuss the project on the Labs [Discord](https://discord.gg/ksSChEZyFs). 

## Are you interested in participating but not sure what to do? 

No worries\! Many people who come have “no idea what to do”, and that is perfectly fine, as long as you are willing to lend your assistance on another project or group during the program. 

# Program Design 

This program will be semi-structured with plenty of open-ended time to explore and experiment. There will be morning “stand up” meetings, where project teams will share their progress and ask questions to the group for things they might need help with. These usually run 30 minutes and try to be efficient so that we can set participants free to work on their projects. 

## Project Teams 

Approximately 5-8 groups will be organized around a focus area, topic, design challenge, or project. The groups will be fluid in that people can interact with multiple groups as the program progresses. Each group will have an assigned representative or leader with a clear goal or motivation to accomplish activities related to the group. 

# Projects 

These are just some of the topics that have been mentioned and/or that we have brainstormed from previous Labs or recurring things that come up in the Fab Lab that would be good to further expand on. *We encourage people to propose their own projects, especially those that are conducive for collaboration.* Please plan to discuss your project at the planning meetings or via Discord so that other participants know what projects are going to be working on. 

* Inflatables   
* Sustainability   
  * *Experimental Materials* – what can be made from natural materials to avoid petroleum products?

# Discord 

We have been using Discord as a communication tool for large-group messaging. While it is another thing to have to check, it ends up being much easier to manage communications between a large group versus email or list serves.

# Registration 

Please complete this brief [**registration form**](https://secure.lglforms.com/form_engine/s/FtKwM1gC074gZSFSBBjBaA) by **July 12** to secure your spot at Labs. If you have any questions, please contact James ([james@haystack-mtn.org](mailto:james@haystack-mtn.org)). 

# Planning & Coordinating 

## Zoom Meetings

We will facilitate 3 1-hour planning meetings – June, July, and August leading up to the event. You are not expected to attend all three, but at least one leading up to the event, so that you can introduce yourself and discuss potential projects. 

* *First* – [**June 3 | 2:00pm ET**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/event?action=TEMPLATE&tmeid=MHVpYm9iNmdvOWxtMzU3dDRjNnBqZmxrYnUgY19kMjAwYzBlZWFjZmMyMWMwYWQyYWNjNzM4ZjZlYjU4MDk0ODg4ZDUwNmM5M2Y2ODVlMWZhNmIzYjg1MGYxMjY5QGc&tmsrc=c_d200c0eeacfc21c0ad2acc738f6eb58094888d506c93f685e1fa6b3b850f1269%40group.calendar.google.com)  
* *Second* – [**July 9 | 3:00pm ET**](https://vimeo.com/981998077?share=copy)  
* *Third* – [**August 15 | 4:00pm ET**](https://us02web.zoom.us/j/89512012965?pwd=ispfWdNeZJKYLi8lVBcJRrzj2tBirw.1) 

# Outcomes & Deliverables

This section is a bit experimental and aspirational. There are a couple of meta-projects that we hope to accomplish from Labs this year. Some of this is based on previous discussions from past Labs about what we could do with this type of program, given all the amazing people who participate. Here some potential things we could produce: 

1. A publication (digital, physical, or online) that disseminations information about the projects and people behind Labs. This could come in several formats: 1\) an actionable version of the projects so that people could replicate these projects and experiments (open-source documentation), or 2\) a narrative story-telling version of the people, projects, and experiences that occur during Labs.   
2. A network of people 

# Education Group Planning Call 

Notes go here… 

* Makerspaces as spaces for spiritual transformation, how can these spaces benefit humanity   
* Different topics or questions for different days or discussion topics.  
  * Driving questions, like “so what?” “What does this mean for the larger conversation?”  
  * Community   
  * Road maps   
  * Reflecting on what is Labs and how this group continues to collaborate post-Labs event. A topic towards the end   
  * How Haystack Labs can support Haystack?  
  * How can Haystack Labs can support other communities of makers?   
* Parking lots for ideas, a giant post-it sticky note to write down thoughts throughout the week   
* Goal: to have a document or something to output and share with the group, to have a coherent thoughts   
* Having dedicated meeting times during the sessions, right after lunch (1pm)  
  * How to structure learning around foundational skills but also having a playful and exciting relationship with the technologies?   
  * How much fundamental knowledge do you need to solve problems?   
* Collection different topics, vote on the topics. Maybe on Thursday night?   
* What are the values of the Haystack Labs? And the ethos of the program?  
* Dedicated Wall Space: Sticky Notes \+   
* Making time and space for local community organizational leaders to come up and visit   
* Maine is unique   
* Community

There are a number of ways in which you can contribute and help ensure the sustainability of the program into the future and to keep this program free to participants:

1. If your organization is able and willing to sponsor you to attend this type of program for professional development or scholarly work, we can assist with documentation and/or requirements that you may need to access resources.   
2. If you have independent means to contribute to the program, Haystack accepts donations and as a 501c3 your contribution may be tax deductible.  
3. If you or your organization have access to sponsorship support of programs such as Haystack Labs, we are pleased to discuss underwriting opportunities.  
4. If you or your organization have tools, materials, or equipment that may be contributed to the program or to Haystack, please contact James Rutter ([james@haystack-mtn.org](mailto:james@haystack-mtn.org)) to discuss further; your contribution may be accepted as an in-kind donation.
