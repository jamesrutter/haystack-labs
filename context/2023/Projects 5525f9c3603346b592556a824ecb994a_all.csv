High-res Scanner,"This project set out to build a machine capable of capturing micro-scale textures, which could be applied to a 3D modeled file, or blown up and put in places where they don't belong using digital fabrication. An open-source database of textures would be useful for artists, craftspeople, and designers interested in using digital fabrication to aid their respective craft / manufacturing method. Unfortunately existing texture maps used in 3D modeling and rendering software are often applied as flat shaders. This means that when looking for 3D models, it's common to find that they lack surface topology necessary for creating a complete 3D representation. A 1-axis 3D scanner was designed and built, which used a DIY tubular linear motor to traverse a laser line scanner across an artifact of interest. By mapping associated linear positions to line scans, we can recreate a 3D representation of an object or texture with up to 30um of resolution. Over the course of the haystack labs the scanner was used to capture textures of found objects from Haystack's coastline, including a shell and leaf, as well as crafted objects, including the broken edge of a ceramic serving bowl among others.",3D Scanning,David Preiss (People%20e15607f12c9542229f6890e1fa0afce1/David%20Preiss%20ba80edacbf954c72bb260c572019ebf6.csv)
