# Clay Printing + Leoâ€™s Design Tool

# **Ceramics Printing**

This group will be exploring and developing new workflows with 3D ceramic printing using several different clay printers.

This project brings together a group of innovative minds to explore new design workflows and fabrication techniques in ceramic art using Delta WASP and 6-axis Robotic Clay extruders. The initiative integrates technology, craftsmanship, and sustainability, creating a platform for experimenting with recycled waste from Haystack and its surrounding areas. Using the 6-axis machine, the group will challenge the traditional confines of design, exploring unconventional geometry in ceramics. The ultimate aim of this project is to foster innovation in ceramic design and production techniques, encourage sustainability through recycled materials, and inspire the artistic community to redefine the possibilities of ceramic art.

**People**: Hideo Mabuchi, Graham Yeager, Dana Maringo, Timea Tihanyi, Giulio Buscaroli, RJ Weaver, Nathan King

**Experiments & Activities:**

**Tools & Materials:** Delta WASP 40100 Clay Printer + Continuous Feeding,
