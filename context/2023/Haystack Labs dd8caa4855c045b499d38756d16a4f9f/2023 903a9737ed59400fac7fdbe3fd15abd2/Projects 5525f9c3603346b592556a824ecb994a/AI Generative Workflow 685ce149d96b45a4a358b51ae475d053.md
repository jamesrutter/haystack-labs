# AI Generative Workflow

# **Emergent Design Workflows: AI and VR-based Digital Fabrication**

This project will explore the untapped potentials of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Virtual Reality (VR) in digital fabrication. It seeks to create novel interfaces between artists and machines, enhancing the experience and ease of modeling and designing. The initiative aims to leverage emergent technologies to develop intuitive and immersive tools and techniques that offer unprecedented control and precision. By integrating AI and VR, artists can transform their creative processes, unlocking new possibilities in design and fabrication. Ultimately, this project aspires to push the boundaries of digital artistry, pioneering a new era of creative expression that blurs the line between the physical and digital worlds.

Valdemar: AI to 3D print design with function, ideation tool, arduino code generation on the fly (machines that rewrite their code), circuit design assistance (suggest what components to use for intended outcome), ask datasheets questions.
