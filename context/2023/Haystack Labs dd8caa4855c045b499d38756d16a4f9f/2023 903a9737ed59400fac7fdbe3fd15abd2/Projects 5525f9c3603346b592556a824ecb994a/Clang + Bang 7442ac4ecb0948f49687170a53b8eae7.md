# **Electronic Music & Robotics**

This project aims to delve into the intersection of technology and music by investigating various real-time feedback control systems for creating electronic music and constructing innovative robotic instruments. It converges art and science, allowing artists to create immersive soundscapes using advanced technological tools. The project will explore robotic instruments' potential to generate unique musical tones and examine their capabilities in response to real-time feedback control systems. This initiative seeks to push the boundaries of electronic music, opening up new dimensions of sound exploration, and inspiring musicians and technologists to redefine the future of musical composition and performance.
