# Haystack Labs

[Haystack Labs](https://www.haystack-mtn.org/haystack-labs)


## What is it? 
Haystack Labs is a one-week experimental program that invites a diverse collection of creative professionals from around the world (mostly US-based, though) to explore the relationship between craft and technology. Over the span of the week, participants will work on producing new processes, tools, machines, and other resources that may inform the craft community. This is not a formal conference or summit, rather a charrette in that people will be intensely working during their time at Haystack with the intentions of producing projects that fall within the craft and technology domain. 


“Artist residencies are valuable because they take you out of your usual context and shake up your thinking.Haystack + Fab Lab is amazing because it takes these machines and puts them in an entirely new creative context, which changes how you see them. Haystack Labs is like a residency for machines / machine residency because machines (like the artists) are going to a new context and exploring creative possibilities.” Sophia Brueckner (Labs ‘23) 

## How did it start? 
In 2021, Haystack Mountain School of Crafts and the MIT Center for Bits and Atoms developed and piloted an experimental residential program, which is referred to as Haystack Labs. The goal of the program is to bring artists, designers, material scientists, machine builders, and coders together and take over Haystack’s campus and studios to explore the integration of emerging technologies and processes for craft. The pilot was so successful that the program ran again in 2022, and expanded to include a broader collection of people from both craft and digital fabrication communities. Over 40 people participated and contributed to a variety of innovative projects that will help inform artists how to integrate craft, as well as how machine/tool/software designers can best serve creative makers. 

## Format 
The format of the program is semi-structure with a morning planning meeting with all participants and evening short presentations. The rest of the day is entirely dependent on what participants happen to be working on but could include a number of activities such as pop-up demos, tutorials, meetings, collaborative projects, experimentations, investigations, deep-dives, and independent studio/lab time to complete projects. 


### Daily Expectations + Schedule. 
It is expected that participants attend morning planning meetings to share out progress on projects throughout the week. During these meetings, participants may seek out additional support from the group and a daily schedule of activities and experimentations is loosely assembled. In addition, Haystack asks all participants to document their projects and help contribute to the larger knowledge base of technology and craft. Finally, participants will be asked to conduct a short presentation about their background and work as it relates to the themes and topics of the program. 

### Agenda. 
In the past, the agenda was set by the participants and the emergent projects from the collaborations and interactions. For this upcoming year, program organizers may help guide participants towards specific projects, themes and topics to explore during the week. For example, this may include developing new materials from the School’s wastestream as part of its efforts to become more sustainable.

### Studio/Equipment Use. 
Studio experts in particular fields of craft will be invited as participants to help facilitate crossover experimentation within studios and guide other participants through new processes. This will allow for deep experimentation, learning, and integration between technology and craft disciplines. All studios (with the exception of Glass) will be accessible for participants to interact and experiment with.   

### Deliverables/Monograph. 
Past iterations of the program have produced short project videos and documentation via website. Any code or designs developed are shared via GitHub or other open-source sharing platforms. For this coming year, Haystack aims to expand its deliverables and produces a video and print document (monograph) for the craft community. This will help expand upon the work of the participants and allow for wider dissemination of information from the knowledge that is co-constructed and generated during the program. 
Potential participants for 2023. Rich Miner (Android co-founder), Adam Savage (Mythbusters), Tom Bodett (Hatchspace), Max Lobovsky (Formlabs co-founder), Josef Prusa (Prusa, founder), Limor Fried (Adafruit, founder). Haystack and MIT balance the invitation list to ensure that the participants are diverse and representatives across a number of factors. 
2022 – Conclusions & Final Thoughts 
Overall, the overwhelming majority of participants viewed this experience as positive and a worthwhile investment of their time. One important feedback was about having a dedicated guru/expert in each particular studio discipline. For instance, Joe Wood was an expert in metals and was able to collaborate with participants and provide a means to engage with this process. Other studios would benefit from a similar dynamic and relationship. Having access to all the studios was a really powerful framework for this event. 
Frequency. This event would be something that people would be interested in participating in subsequent years. Most people indicated that this could be once per year, but would need to be rotated with who comes so as to not include the same people every year. 
Duration. Participants arrived on Sunday Some people felt like they were just getting started. Meaning, they had just finally built the machine/perfected the process and were ready to begin experimenting. Others said that it was the perfect duration and that longer would have been prohibitive to participating in the event. A tight/short timeline leaves people wanting more (or hungry as one person put it). 
Location. Many agreed that Haystack provides a unique venue for hosting such an event. The studios have been used for many years, standing on a pyramid of knowledge and history. This allowed for deep engagement with craft processes and integration with technology. However, some did indicate that such an event could be replicated elsewhere but it would be important to have the studio access that Haystack’s campus provides. 
Value of participating from industry partners
PensaLabs, who is currently developing a new wire-bending machine, was able to receive useful feedback from fellow superusers in related fields. This user experience provides new insight for companies developing hardware and software tools in the manufacturing and fabrication industry. Additionally, software developers generously collaborated with PensaLabs to develop custom-made tools for the machine. This type of rapid R&D with creative communities provides a unique incubation space for industry. 
Diversity of knowledge and expertise 
This event has a unique approach in bringing people from different backgrounds together to collaborate. Artists from a variety of backgrounds, makers of different technologies, founders, teachers, community organizers, all coming together to share ideas/collaborate and work together. People in the early, mid, and late stages of their careers all participated as well. This provided lots of exposure to new ways of thinking and making the people who came.  
Leaving behind resources and knowledge for future generations to enjoy. Who is going to be the beneficiares of this work? The Haystack commiunity. We have 500+ people, 50+ faculty, etc. We are running online programs. We are a research institute in the arts community and you are helping shape that. standing on a pyramid of knowledge
