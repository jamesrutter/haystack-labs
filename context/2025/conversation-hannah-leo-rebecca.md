## II. Digital Knitting Experiments
**Contributor: Hannah Twigg-Smith**

### "Magic-Eye" Autostereogram Tool

**Technical Development:**
- Created browser-based application for designing depth-maps and base tiles
- Outputs knit-ready images that enable shifting "Magic Eye" illusions in fabric
- **Future Integration:** Plans to knit one of Leo's generated patterns as the stereogram base once machine is operational

**Innovation:** Successfully bridges digital image processing with physical textile production, creating new possibilities for optical illusion fabrics.

### Electronic Knitting-Machine Revival

**Hardware Diagnostics & Repair:**
- Diagnosed decades-old electronic carriage malfunction
- **Root Cause:** Exploded transistor traced to shorted solenoid
- **Repair Process:** Solenoid unwound for coil replacement
- **Materials:** Salvaged magnet wire (28–32 AWG) for rewinding
- **Testing Plan:** If repair successful, will knit test swatch for validation

### $10 RP2040 Controller ("knits-or")

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Interface:** Web-serial interface runs entirely in browser
- **Input Methods:** Accepts live sketches or uploaded PNG files
- **Processing:** Tiles images to chosen needle span, streams instructions via original 5-pin "MIDI" cable
- **Future Development:** Plans with Zach to embed board inside carriage, replace massive OEM PCB, and upgrade to USB-C connector

**Impact:** Dramatically reduces cost and complexity of machine control while maintaining compatibility with legacy hardware.

## III. Generative Design Tools
**Contributor: Leo McElroy**

### Braid-Design Web Application

**Technical Framework:**
- Developed new JSON-like braid description language
- **Workflow:** Design moves → simulate structure → preview results → iterate pattern
- **User Interface:** Supports both hand-written and algorithmic pattern generation
- **Output:** Serves as manual guide for physical braid creation

**Innovation:** Bridges computational design with traditional braiding techniques, enabling complex pattern exploration.

### Embroidery Image Import Tool ("outlet")

**Functionality:**
- Added PNG import capability for graphics-to-stitch conversion
- **Community Support:** Guided Rebecca's cease-and-desist samplers and Thierry's image embroideries
- **Accessibility:** Enables non-technical users to incorporate digital imagery into embroidered works

**Impact:** Democratizes access to digital embroidery by simplifying file conversion process.

## IV. Sustainable Materials & Activism
**Contributor: Rebecca Hui**

### Algae Inks & Pigments Development

**Material Process:**
- **Sourcing:** Daily foraging along shore for seaweed varieties
- **Processing:** Converting seaweed into liquid concentrates and solid cakes
- **Variables:** Testing glycerol and pH variations for optimal color and binding properties
- **Collaboration:** Working with Alex in dye kitchen for process refinement
- **Long-term Goal:** Develop DIY seaweed craft kit for educational use

### Multimedia "Seaweed Board" Pipeline

**Production Workflow:**
1. 3D-scan motifs using Quentin's scanner
2. Laser-etch imagery onto substrate board
3. Finish with custom algae pigments

**Innovation:** Integrates digital fabrication with bio-based materials for unique artistic outcomes.

### Embroidery Samplers as Social Commentary

**Concept:** Embroidered provocative snippets from past lawsuit cease-and-desist letters as textile commentary
**Technical Support:** Collaborated with Leo's embroidery tools for implementation
**Impact:** Demonstrates use of traditional craft techniques for contemporary social/political expression

### "Manatee Ice Cubes" Climate Activism

**Project Scope:**
- **Goal:** Create conversation starter for COP 30 climate discussions
- **Method:** Drop slowly-melting manatee-shaped ice into lobbyist cocktails
- **Technical Implementation:** Collaborated with Zach on complex 3D-printed silicone mold design
- **Strategy:** Playful intervention to prompt serious climate conversations
