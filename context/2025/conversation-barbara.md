## II. Seal-Scar Cyanotype Documentation

### Photo-ID Library Development

**Subject Identification:**
- **Primary Subject:** Male harbor seal **AO 17 "Johannes"**
- **Distinctive Features:** Unique scar pattern suitable for individual identification
- **Documentation Method:** Contact-printed scar patterns using cyanotype process

**Technical Process:**
1. Cotton substrate coated with cyanotype solution
2. Direct contact printing of seal scar patterns
3. **Purpose:** Build comprehensive photo-ID library for future fieldwork
4. **Application:** Enable non-invasive individual tracking and behavioral studies

**Scientific Value:**
- Creates permanent, archival record of individual seal identification markers
- Establishes baseline documentation for long-term population studies
- Demonstrates intersection of traditional photography with contemporary field biology

## III. Biomaterial & Substrate Experiments

### Bio-fact Integration Trials

**Experimental Approach:**
- **Method:** Embedded small organic samples in cyanotype-thickened "goop"
- **Challenge:** One test piece liquefied in sun exposure
- **Resolution:** Disposed sample back to nature (appropriate for organic materials)
- **Learning:** Identified need for stabilization methods when combining biological materials with photographic chemistry

### Surface Durability Testing

**Material Exploration:**

| Substrate            | Application Method | Initial Result       | Long-term Performance       |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Leather**          | Brush application  | Unsuccessful         | N/A - poor initial adhesion |
| **Cement**           | Brush application  | Initially successful | Fugitive over time          |
| **Cotton** (control) | Standard coating   | Successful           | Stable, archival quality    |

**Research Implications:**
- Traditional cotton substrate remains optimal for archival applications
- Alternative substrates require chemistry modifications for permanence
- Environmental exposure testing essential for outdoor installation planning

## IV. Digital Fabrication Integration

### Laser-Cut Wood Matrix Development

**Collaboration:** Partnership initiated with Zach following Labs introduction
**Technical Plan:**
- **Method:** Carve second wood block using laser cutting
- **Purpose:** Register multi-layer exposures for complex cyanotype compositions
- **Innovation:** Combines traditional contact printing with precision digital fabrication
- **Advantage:** Enables repeatable, aligned multi-layer exposures

### Plastic Sheet Transfer Experiments

**Collaborative Development:**
- **Partner:** MIT participant (unnamed in notes)
- **Process:** Map drawings onto thin plastic sheets for translucent cyanotypes
- **Innovation:** Creates semi-transparent masks for complex exposure effects
- **Comparison Planned:** Laser engraving vs. UV-printed masks before coating application

**Technical Potential:**
- Enables gradient effects impossible with traditional contact printing
- Creates opportunities for layered narrative in single exposures
- Bridges digital design tools with analog photographic processes

## V. Conservation & Data Advocacy

### Maritime Navigation Enhancement

**Problem Identification:**
- **Gap:** Maritime navigation manuals ignore whale migration routes
- **Risk:** Commercial shipping conflicts with marine mammal movement patterns
- **Opportunity:** Integrate biological data with navigation systems

**Proposed Solution:**
- **Collaboration:** Partner with Luigi for comprehensive approach
- **Method:** Combine photo-ID documentation with behavior tracking
- **Goal:** Protect little-studied species through data-informed shipping policies
- **Output:** Advocate for migration-aware navigation protocols

**Research Integration:**
- Cyanotype documentation serves as archival component of larger conservation dataset
- Visual advocacy materials support policy development and public education
- Traditional craft techniques make scientific data accessible to broader audiences

## VI. Program Reflection & Cultural Analysis

### Cross-Disciplinary Learning Environment

**Confidence Building:**
- **Environment:** Peer group that "breaks, burns, and learns"
- **Impact:** Gained courage to iterate publicly and experiment openly
- **Value:** Cross-disciplinary validation encouraged risk-taking and innovation

### Pedagogical Format Assessment

**"Speed-Dating-to-Self-Directed" Structure:**
- **Benefit:** Freed artists from overly teacher-led structures
- **Outcome:** Encouraged genuine experimentation and peer collaboration
- **Philosophy:** "Play as Practice" - serious learning through experimental play
- **Innovation:** Rapid introduction followed by sustained self-directed work

**Cultural Contribution:**
- Demonstrates value of maker culture for scientific research
- Models integration of traditional craft skills with contemporary research needs
- Shows how artistic practice can enhance scientific communication and advocacy
