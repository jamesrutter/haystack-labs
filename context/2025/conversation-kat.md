I. Kat’s work during Labs week

Biology-meets-craft experiments

Revived traditional skills (jewelry making, glass-blowing, cyanotypes) by embedding living materials—e.g., plating color-changing bacteria inside resin or glass beads, trapping DNA in jewelry blanks, and exposing cyanotype papers with biological motifs 2025-labs-kat.

Collaboratively remixed supplies everyone brought under time pressure, proving that improvised “craft + bio” mash-ups can work surprisingly well 2025-labs-kat.

Hands-on microbiology demos

Participants plated pigmented bacteria on paper, fibers, foods, etc.; next-day color shifts (“it’s pink!”) helped demystify lab work and made the process feel like primary-school crafts 2025-labs-kat.

Experiments ranged from dyeing yarn and paper to a playful (and informative) failed attempt at screen-printing live cultures—bacteria grew everywhere except the printed region, yielding an accidental negative painting 2025-labs-kat.

DNA & molecular storytelling

Fast, visual DNA extractions captured the group’s imagination and sparked discussions about seeing every studio material at the molecular scale 2025-labs-kat.

Long-range idea: culture microbes for four weeks ahead of a session, then process them into ethanol-based “coral” paints grown entirely on site 2025-labs-kat.

Key outcomes & insights

Biosafety-Level-1 (BSL-1) biology dovetails naturally with craft because it is tactile, visually rewarding, and low-risk 2025-labs-kat.

Color-producing strains are a reliable “gateway” activity; future sessions could layer in glow-in-the-dark dinoflagellates or mycelium forms for added wonder .

The experience reminded makers that collaborating with living organisms changes timelines and ethics—artists must design with growth, decay, and killing in mind 2025-labs-kat.

II. What Haystack needs to launch an on-campus biomaterials lab

Component	Minimum spec / rationale	Notes on placement & use
Clean work surface	One clearly sign-posted “clean table” kept free of clay-dust and sawdust for sterile tasks 2025-labs-kat	Should be within reach of a sink for easy hand-washing and bleach wipe-downs
Sink with fresh water	Immediate access is essential for hand hygiene and dishwashing 2025-labs-kat	Many studios already qualify (photo darkroom, dye kitchen, fibers)
Core equipment	• Table-top incubator (keeps cultures at 30–37 °C)	
• Mini fridge (4 L) for media & strains		
• Bleach / ethanol spray bottles, gloves, forceps, inoculation loops		
• Small UV or alcohol torch for quick sterilization	All items came in Kat’s starter kit and are shelf-stable; nothing expires quickly 2025-labs-kat	
Consumables	Dehydrated agar/media powders, Petri dishes, pipettes, disposable loops—powdered form stores indefinitely 2025-labs-kat	Re-order annually; very low cost
Mobile storage	Design a wheeled BioCart with locking doors and a pull-out clean shelf so the whole setup can roll between Fab Lab, dye kitchen, outreach classrooms, etc.	Handles + towel/bleach caddy recommended
BSL-1 protocol sheet	One-page poster of do’s/don’ts, color bacteria “recipes,” and spill response	Laminate and mount on the cart and next to the clean table
Studio integration (“mycelium model”)	Treat the BioCart as a central rhizome; individual studios borrow strains/tools for local experiments (e.g., darkroom for cyanotypes, fibers for bacterial dyes) 2025-labs-kat	Mirrors the way DigiFab tools now sprout up campus-wide

Programmatic suggestions

Front-load longer cultures – Start pigment cultures 4 weeks before a workshop so participants can mill, decant, and paint with truly “site-grown” colors 2025-labs-kat.

Gateway activities – Kick off each session with color bacteria plating (1-day reveal) to hook newcomers; follow with fiber/paper dye baths, then DNA art or glowing dinoflagellates for deeper dives .

Residency fit – Two-week Labs residencies work, but month-long residencies would let artists shepherd slower biomaterials (mycelium, pigment fermentation) from start to finish 2025-labs-kat.

Open toolkit mindset – Provide the safe, sterile baseline; let visiting experts bring specialty vats, bespoke glassware, or silk scaffolds, just as indigo dyers tote their own vats 2025-labs-kat.

Takeaway: With nothing more than a sink-adjacent corner, a small fridge, an incubator, and a thoughtfully designed rolling cart, Haystack can seed a nimble BSL-1 biomaterials lab. This compact “kit” aligns with the school’s mycelium-style model—rooted in the Fab Lab but ready to pop up in any studio—so students and visiting makers can keep exploring the lively frontier between craft and the living world.
