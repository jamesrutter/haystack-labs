**Date:** June 2025

## I. Lab Activities & Experiments During Labs Week

### Biology-Meets-Craft Experiments

**Traditional Skills Revival with Living Materials**
- Revived traditional crafts (jewelry making, glass-blowing, cyanotypes) by embedding living materials
- Experiments included:
  - Plating color-changing bacteria inside resin or glass beads
  - Trapping DNA in jewelry blanks
  - Exposing cyanotype papers with biological motifs
- Successfully demonstrated that improvised "craft + bio" mashups work under time pressure through collaborative remixing of supplies

### Hands-On Microbiology Demonstrations

**Accessible Biology Education**
- Participants plated pigmented bacteria on various substrates: paper, fibers, foods
- Next-day color shifts ("it's pink!") effectively demystified lab work
- Made the process feel approachable, similar to primary-school crafts
- Experiments ranged from dyeing yarn and paper to screen-printing attempts
- **Notable outcome:** Failed screen-printing attempt with live cultures resulted in bacteria growing everywhere *except* the printed region, creating an accidental negative painting

### DNA & Molecular Storytelling

**Engaging Scientific Visualization**
- Fast, visual DNA extractions captured group imagination
- Sparked discussions about viewing studio materials at the molecular scale
- **Long-range concept:** Culture microbes for 4 weeks ahead of sessions, then process into ethanol-based "coral" paints grown entirely on-site

### Key Outcomes & Insights

- **Safety & Accessibility:** BSL-1 (Biosafety Level 1) biology integrates naturally with craft because it is:
  - Tactile and visually rewarding
  - Low-risk and safe for educational environments
- **Gateway Activities:** Color-producing bacterial strains serve as reliable entry points
- **Future Enhancements:** Sessions could incorporate:
  - Glow-in-the-dark dinoflagellates
  - Mycelium forms for added wonder
- **Ethical Considerations:** Working with living organisms requires artists to design with growth, decay, and organism lifecycle in mind

## II. Infrastructure Requirements for On-Campus Biomaterials Lab

### Essential Components

| Component                | Minimum Specification                                                                                                                                                              | Placement & Usage Notes                                                                                              |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Clean Work Surface**   | One clearly sign-posted "clean table" kept free of clay-dust and sawdust                                                                                                           | Within reach of sink for hand-washing and bleach wipe-downs                                                          |
| **Fresh Water Access**   | Immediate sink access                                                                                                                                                              | Essential for hand hygiene and equipment washing; many studios already qualify (photo darkroom, dye kitchen, fibers) |
| **Core Equipment**       | • Table-top incubator (30–37°C)<br>• Mini fridge (4L) for media & strains<br>• Bleach/ethanol spray bottles<br>• Gloves, forceps, inoculation loops<br>• Small UV or alcohol torch | All items shelf-stable; nothing expires quickly                                                                      |
| **Consumables**          | Dehydrated agar/media powders, Petri dishes, pipettes, disposable loops                                                                                                            | Powdered form stores indefinitely; re-order annually at low cost                                                     |
| **Mobile Storage**       | Wheeled BioCart with locking doors and pull-out clean shelf                                                                                                                        | Enables movement between Fab Lab, dye kitchen, outreach classrooms; include handles + towel/bleach caddy             |
| **Safety Documentation** | BSL-1 protocol sheet with do's/don'ts, bacteria "recipes," spill response                                                                                                          | Laminate and mount on cart and next to clean table                                                                   |

### Studio Integration Strategy

**"Mycelium Model" Approach**
- Treat BioCart as central rhizome/hub
- Individual studios borrow strains/tools for local experiments:
  - Darkroom: cyanotype work
  - Fibers: bacterial dyes
  - Other studios: material-specific applications
- Mirrors current DigiFab tool distribution model across campus

## III. Programmatic Recommendations

### Timeline Optimization
- **Front-load longer cultures:** Start pigment cultures 4 weeks before workshops so participants can mill, decant, and paint with truly "site-grown" colors
- **Residency compatibility:** 
  - Two-week Labs residencies: functional but limited
  - Month-long residencies: ideal for shepherding slower biomaterials (mycelium, pigment fermentation) from start to finish

### Activity Progression
1. **Gateway Activities:** Begin sessions with color bacteria plating (1-day reveal) to engage newcomers
2. **Intermediate Projects:** Follow with fiber/paper dye baths
3. **Advanced Work:** DNA art or glowing dinoflagellates for deeper exploration

### Resource Philosophy
- **Open toolkit mindset:** Provide safe, sterile baseline infrastructure
- Allow visiting experts to bring specialty equipment (vats, bespoke glassware, silk scaffolds)
- Similar to how indigo dyers bring their own vats

## IV. Implementation Summary

**Minimal Viable Setup:**
- Sink-adjacent corner location
- Small fridge and incubator
- Thoughtfully designed rolling cart
- Basic safety protocols

**Alignment with Haystack Model:**
- Compact "kit" approach fits school's philosophy
- Rooted in Fab Lab but deployable to any studio
- Enables continued exploration of craft-biology frontier
- Supports both visiting makers and ongoing student work

---

**Next Steps:**
1. Identify optimal studio location with sink access
2. Source and configure mobile BioCart
3. Develop safety protocols and training materials
4. Plan initial programming with color bacteria gateway activities
