## II. Algae-Based Inks & Pigments

### Seaweed → Ink Pipeline Development

**Collaborative Process with Rebecca:**
- **Material Sourcing:** Processed several locally-foraged algae species
- **Processing Method:** Heat and concentrate algae into pigment bases
- **Chemical Enhancement:** Experimented with alkaline boosters for hue shift and stability
- **Goal:** Create viable ink alternatives from abundant coastal resources

### Binder Optimization Research

**Planned Systematic Testing:**
- **Test Materials:** Gum tragacanth, xanthan gum, and guar gum
- **Evaluation Criteria:** Viscosity, flow properties, and application suitability
- **Application Targets:** Both fabric and paper substrates
- **Methodology:** Side-by-side comparison to identify optimal "inkable" paste formulation

**Status:** Testing framework established; comparative analysis to continue post-Labs

## III. "Sludgecraft" Resist-Dye Trials

### DIY Sludge Resist Formulation

**Base Recipe:**
- Brown-rice flour
- Lime
- Water
- Guar gum
- **Variant:** Enhanced with Tom's sawdust for additional texture

**Application Process:**
1. Mixed ingredients to spreadable consistency
2. Applied to cotton substrates
3. Immersed treated fabric in dye baths
4. **Pending:** Rinse-out wash to reveal resist patterns

**Innovation:** Explores accessible, food-safe resist materials as alternative to traditional wax or chemical resists

## VI. Program Reflection & Future Directions

### Synthetic Biology Integration

**Key Insight:** Week's exposure reignited interest in combining craft processes with synthetic biology
**Potential Applications:**
- Engineered organisms for pigment production
- Bio-responsive dye systems
- Living material integration with traditional fiber arts

### Program Format Assessment

**Duration Analysis:**
- **Positive:** Rapid one-week sprint creates productive, open-ended experimentation
- **Challenge:** Simultaneously exhausting pace
- **Strategic Value:** Unfinished experiments serve as incubators for longer-term work post-departure
- **Outcome:** Multiple research threads established for continued development
