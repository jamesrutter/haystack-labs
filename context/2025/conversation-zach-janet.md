## I. Project Overview & Motivation

### Problem Statement
- Water-jet cutters consume approximately **1 lb of garnet per minute** (~$0.50/lb)
- Creates a sizable waste stream of "environmentally inert" material typically destined for landfill
- Opportunity to convert waste into valuable craft materials

### Project Goals
- Transform water-jet garnet waste into useful, teachable, and potentially profitable craft materials
- Engage broad participation across the Haystack community
- Develop accessible documentation and replicable processes

## II. Materials & Methodology

### Materials Collected

| Waste/Binder                         | Source                                        | Notes                                                                         | Test Outcome                        |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Dried, sieved water-jet "sludge"** | Main aggregate from water-jet operations      | Primary waste material                                                        | Stable after firing                 |
| **Reclaimed clay slip**              | Barrel outside ceramics studio                | Mixed 50:50 with sludge                                                       | Strong, ceramic-like tiles          |
| **Small-batch binders**              | Various sources ("everything goopy at Blick") | Polyurethane, epoxy, alginate, wax, plaster, Portland cement, UV-cure polymer | Screened for quick-set and toxicity |

### Core Recipe & Firing Protocol

```
50 wt% dried sludge + 50 wt% reclaimed clay slip
→ Hand-mix to "pizza-dough" consistency
→ Shape and air-dry
→ Fire in medium Bailey kiln: 550°F/h ramp to Cone 04 (~1945°F)
```

*Exact firing schedule logged in lab notebook for repeatability*

## III. Results & Outcomes

### Mechanical Performance
- **Durability Testing:** Tiles survived campus-style "Neil drop + stomp" stress test before finally cracking
- **Surface Properties:** Pressed woven fabrics into greenware; after firing, surface acted as a rasp capable of cutting soft metals
- **Production Scale:** Created >100 test pieces, filling >½ of medium Bailey kiln in single firing

### Community Engagement
- **Participation Rate:** Distributed "gross-butter" pucks of mix across campus
- **Adoption:** >50% of people on campus created something with the sludge material
- Demonstrated successful model for inclusive materials research

## IV. Collaborative Experiments & Cross-Studio Work

| Experiment                                            | Collaborating Group/Partner | Key Takeaway                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Fabric stiffening for speaker membranes**           | Weaving group               | Success; achieved stiffer hand feel                    |
| **"Monster-exfoliator" soap bars + soap dishes**      | Alex                        | Abrasive texture, engaging for users                   |
| **Silk-glue + sludge plates & rubber-ducky castings** | Silk workshop               | Proof-of-concept for mold applications                 |
| **Plaster-sludge + cyanotype solution**               | Cyanotype crew              | Interesting color shifts; requires further development |

## V. Technical Infrastructure Support

*Zach's concurrent technical support activities during Labs week:*

| System/Equipment                 | Issue                                                      | Resolution/Status                                                                            |

## VII. Key Insights & Implications

### Technical Findings
1. **Circular Crafting Success:** Water-jet garnet combined with clay slip produces robust ceramics with minimal new material input
2. **Material Properties:** Fired sludge composites demonstrate both structural integrity and useful abrasive characteristics
3. **Scalability:** Process scales effectively from small test pieces to kiln-filling production runs

### Process Innovation
